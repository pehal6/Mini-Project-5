# ðŸ§ª Mini project 5: File Conversion to Uppercase

This mini project measures and compares the **time taken by different programming languages** â€” **Python**, **C++**, and **R** â€” to convert large text files (200MB to 1000MB) to **uppercase**.

---

## ðŸ§  Objective

To evaluate how different programming languages handle large file processing, specifically:
- Reading large `.txt` files (200MB to 1000MB)
- Measuring the **execution time**
